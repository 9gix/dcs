        "description": "Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called \"Divide-and-Conquer\"), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition. As of the third edition, this textbook is published exclusively by the MIT Press.",

        "description": "This volume helps take some of the \"mystery\" out of identifying and dealing with key algorithms. Drawing heavily on the author's own real-world experiences, the book stresses design and analysis. Coverage is divided into two parts, the first being a general guide to techniques for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the 75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division course or as a student reference guide. THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with a CD-ROM that contains: * a complete hypertext version of the full printed book. * the source code and URLs for all cited implementations. * over 30 hours of audio lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line lecture notes.",

        "description": "#1 New York Times Bestseller\r\n\r\nFrom the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the Lusitania\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era\u2019s great transatlantic \u201cGreyhounds\u201d\u2014the fastest liner then in service\u2014and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. \r\n\r\nGermany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger\u2019s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small\u2014hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more\u2014all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.\r\n\r\nIt is a story that many of us think we know but don\u2019t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. \r\n\r\nGripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.",

        "description": "A masterful, intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far\u2014a book about the power of storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in Mr. Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWake up, genius.\u201d So begins King\u2019s instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn\u2019t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.\r\n\r\nMorris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he\u2019s released from prison after thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nNot since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life\u2014for good, for bad, forever.",

        "description": "Turn your phone or tablet into an air traffic radar and see planes around the world move in real-time on a detailed map. Or point your Android device at a plane in the sky to find out where it\u2019s going and more. Discover today why millions are already using Flightradar24 - Flight Tracker.\r\n\r\nFeatures that have helped make Flightradar24 - Flight Tracker the #1 selling app in 100+ countries and the #1 Travel app in 140+ countries (United States, France, United Kingdom, Germany and more) include:\r\n* Watch planes move in real-time on detailed map\r\n* Identify planes flying overhead by simply pointing your device at the sky\r\n* Experience what the pilot of a an aircraft sees in real-time and in 3D\r\n* Tap on a plane for comprehensive flight and aircraft information such as route, estimated time of arrival, actual time of departure, aircraft type, speed, altitude, and high-resolution picture\r\n* Easy to search for individual flights using flight number, airport, or airline\r\n* Easy to filter by airline, aircraft, altitude, speed, and more\r\n* Easy to set bookmarks to enable quick navigation to areas of interest\r\n* Turn the device into the arrivals and departures board of any major airport and get real-time status updates for flights plus current airport weather conditions (in-app purchase)\r\n* Realistic aircraft symbols (in-app purchase)\r\n* Set up custom alerts based on airline, aircraft type, flight number or registration (in-app purchase)\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nMost aircraft are equipped with so called ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don\u2019t have ADS-B transponders.\r\n\r\nTraditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works\r\n\r\n***IMPORTANT NOTICES***\r\nMinimum required screen resolution is 320x480px.\r\n\r\nIf you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check Flightradar24.com BEFORE purchasing the app. Flightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we don\u2019t have coverage.\r\n\r\nOverview of coverage as of December 2014:\r\n* Europe: close to 100%\r\n* North America: 100% of US and Canada via slightly delayed radar data. Real-time coverage for most of US, Canada and Mexico for ADS-B equipped aircraft\r\n* South America: Substantial coverage in most countries including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.\r\n* Asia: Substantial coverage in most major Asian countries including Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, UAE, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other countries. Rapidly expanding coverage in China\r\n* Oceania: Nearly complete coverage in Australia and New Zealand\r\n* Africa: Substantial coverage in South Africa. Limited but growing coverage in the rest of the region\r\n\r\nFind out how you can help:\r\nhttp://www.flightradar24.com/increase-coverage\r\n\r\nCoverage is subject to change at any time.\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\r\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/flightradar24 and follow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/flightradar24 for the latest on Flightradar24.\r\n\r\nHELP & SUPPORT\r\nforum.flightradar24.com/threads/89-Important-Read-this-before-you-ask-questions\r\nflightradar24.com/contact-us.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.
